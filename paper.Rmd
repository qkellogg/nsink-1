# Summary

The `nsink` package estimates cumulative nitrogen (N) removal along a specified flowpath and is based on methodologies outlined in Kellogg et al. [ -@kellogg2010geospatial].  `nsink` downloads all required datasets from public datasets in the United States, prepares data for use, summarizes N removal along a flowpath and creates several static watershed maps.  The results of an `nsink` analysis may be exported to standard geospatial files for use in other applications.  

# Statement of need

Excess N delivery via surface water to downstream aquatic resources contributes to impaired water quality and leads to several ecosystem impacts including harmful algal blooms (HABs) and hypoxia [@rabalais2002beyond]. Identifying landscape N sinks (i.e., areas where N is effectively removed from the aquatic system) and analysing N delivery at the watershed scale is helpful to watershed managers, land use planners and conservation organizations.  The theoretical underpinnings for identifying N sinks rely on decades of research and are explained in Kellogg et al. [-@kellogg2010geospatial]. 

The first implementation of this approach was done case-by-case.  Data acquisition and manipulation were mostly manual and took weeks to months to complete for a single watershed.  The effort required for the analysis limited it's application as scaling beyond a few pilot studies was not feasible.  The goal of `nsink` was to address this limitation and provide an open source solution that could be run on a single small watershed in minutes to hours with little manual input.

# The `nsink` package

## Package Installation
The `nsink` package is available from <https://github.com/usepa/nsink> and may be installed in R with the following:

```r
# If not installed, install remotes
install.packages("remotes")

# Install nsink from GitHub
remotes::install_github("USEPA/nsink", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Package Details

The `nsink` package is designed around the major steps in running a N-Sink analysis and includes the following:

1. Prepare for analysis
    - Get data
    - Prepare data for analysis
    - Calculate relative N removal layer for hydric soils, lakes and streams.
2. Run an interactive analysis 
    - Calculate a flowpath 
    - Summarize relative N removal along a flowpath
3. Run a watershed based analysis
    - Develop static maps
    - Generate output datasets

### Required Data

The ability to run an `nsink` analysis relies on several national scale dataset for the United States.  By limiting our approach to these national datasets we are ensuring scalability of `nsink` because the datasets will be available for most locations in the United States.  The datasets that `nsink` uses are the National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus), Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) land cover, and the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) impervious surface [ADD CITATION FOR DATASETS]. These datasets are all available via either an Application Programming Interface (API) or via direct download.   

### Dependencies

The `nsink` package depends on several existing R packages to facilitate spatial data handling, data acquisition, data management, data analysis and data processing.  These are detailed in Table 1.

### Functionality

Currently, `nsink` provides 10 exported functions to facilitate a flowpath-based analysis of relative N removal. 

- `nsink_get_huc_id()`: A function for searching the name of a USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset Hydrologic Unit (<https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/watershed-boundary-dataset>) and retrieving it's 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC).  
- `nsink_get_data()`: Using any acceptable HUC ID (e.g. 2-digit to 12-digit), this function downloads the NHDPlus, SSURGO, NLCD Land Cover, and the NLCD Impervious for that HUC.   
- `nsink_prep_data()`: `nsink` needs data in a common coordinate reference system, from mutliple NHDPlus tables, and from different portions of SSURGO.  This function completes these data preparation steps and outputs all data, clipped to the HUC boundary.
- `nsink_calc_removal()`: Quantifying relative N removal across a landscape is a key aspects of an `nsink` analysis.  The `nsink_calc_removal()` function takes the object returned from `nsink_prep_data()` and calculates relative N removal for each landscape sink.  See Kellogg et al [-@kellogg2010geospatial] for details on relative N removal estimation for each sink.
- `nsink_generate_flowpath()`: This function uses a combination of flow determined by topography (e.g. via a flow-direction raster) for the land-based portions of a flowpath and of downstream flow along the NHDPlus stream network.   
- `nsink_summarize_flowpath()`: Summarizing removal along a specified flowpath requires relative N removal and a generated flowpath.  This function uses these and returns a  summary of relative N removal along a flowpath for each sink. 
- `nsink_generate_static_maps()`: The `nsink_generate_static_maps()` function analyzes N removal at the watershed scale by summarizing the results of multiple flowpaths. Four static maps are returned: 1)removal efficiency; 2)loading index; 3)transport index; 4)delivery index.  Removal efficiency is a rasterized version of the `nsink_calc_removal()` output.  Loading index is N sources based on NLCD categories and ranges from 0 to 1.   Transport index is a heat map with the cumulative relative N removal along flowpaths originating from a grid of points, density set by the user, across a watershed, highlighting the gradient of downstream N retention. Delivery index is the result of multiplying the loading index and the transport index and shows potential N delivery from different sources, taking into account the relative N removal as water moves downstream. 
- `nsink_plot()`: A function that plots each raster in the list returned from `nsink_generate_static_maps()`.   
- `nsink_build()`: One of the drivers behind the development of the `nsink` package was to provide `n-sink` analysis output that could be used more broadly (e.g. within a GIS).  The `nsink_build()` function is a wrapper for a complete `nsink` analysis and outputs R objects returned by each function and shapefiles or TIFF versions of those objects.
- `nsink_load()`: Essentially the inverse of the `nsink_build()` function, this function takes a folder of files, likely created with `nsink_build()`, and reads them in to R.

The R package documentation contains both a detailed description of each function and a vignette that outlines a typical workflow for running an N-Sink analysis with the `nsink` package.  Upon install, the vignette is accessed in R with `vignette("intro", package = "nsink")`.
